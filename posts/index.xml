      <description>I in a nutshell. Hello everyone. I am Filippos but you can call me Phil. I am living in Netherlands since 2019 and my origin is Greek. Currently rocking at 27 years old, trying to increase my expertise in Data Science and currently working at IBM based in Groningen, Netherlands.
Fun fact:
A bit of a history Phil as a person I grew up in a very small Greek town which is called Igoumenitsa and as a usual teenager I was very spontaneous and friendly with a positive vibe.</description>
